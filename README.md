# Predicting trip duration using Pyspark

New York Yellow Taxi cabs are an internationally recognized icon and serve to transport visitors to the city and residents alike, throughout the five boroughs. All Yellow Taxis are equipped with GPS monitoring systems that transmit data to a centralized database.

The [notebook](https://github.com/siddhantmaharana/predict-trip-duration-using-Pyspark/blob/master/Pyspark-%20NYC%20trip%20duration.ipynb)focusses on Pyspark and demonstrates how it can used to ingest ~10 gb worth of data, perform some analysis on them and even predict trip duration using Pyspark's ML libraries.
